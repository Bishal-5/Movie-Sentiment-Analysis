# Movie Sentiment Analysis on "Adipurush" Twitter Comments
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter comments about the movie *Adipurush*. Using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the goal is to classify the sentiment of the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can help gauge public opinion on the movie based on social media feedback.

## Project Overview
The project leverages Python and popular data science libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, and `scikit-learn` to clean, process, and analyze the data. Sentiment analysis is performed using machine learning techniques, and visualizations are created to summarize the results.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Twitter data for comments related to the *Adipurush* movie is collected using the Twitter API.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the data (e.g., removing stop words, punctuation, and links).
   - Tokenization, lemmatization, and text vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
   
3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Training a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest) to classify sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
   - Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Generating visualizations (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) to provide insights into the sentiment distribution and the most common words associated with each sentiment.

5. **Results**:
   - Sentiment distribution of the Twitter comments about *Adipurush*.
   - Insights about how people are reacting to the movie (positive, negative, or neutral).
